# Test-for-hypothyroidism-of-patients-by-Nairobi-Hospital

Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. The main aim for our research would be to use the healthcare datasets provided to build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

# Description
Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone.Hypothyroidism's deficiency of thyroid hormones can disrupt such things as heart rate, body temperature and all aspects of metabolism. Hypothyroidism is most prevalent in older women.Major symptoms include fatigue, cold sensitivity, constipation, dry skin and unexplained weight gain.Treatment consists of thyroid hormone replacement.

For our reaserch, we have this dataset from Nairobi hospital with a number of variables that determine if one has hypothyroidism or not and our aim is to build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.The two main algorithms we are going to use is Decision trees and Support Vector Machine(SVM) and as part of our reserch we will be able to tell which symptoms most influence hypothyroidism.

The reserch will be considrered a success if we are able if we are able to successfully build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

# Setup/Installation Requirements
All you need to run this code is a browser with access to Google CoLab or alternatively Jupyter Notebook can be used.Both tools are for data preparation and analysis. For data manipulation the Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn, scipy and Sklearn libraries should be imported.

The dataset used can be found on this link: http://bit.ly/hypothyroid_data


# Technologies Used
